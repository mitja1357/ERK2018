\begin{abstract}{}
In position sensing encoders and resolvers are used, whose output is a pair of quadrature sine and cosine signals. Angle calculation can be done with atan2 function. Due to improper installation of sensor, sine and cosine signal can be deformed. In that case calculated angle includes error. Error was analyzed for non-equal amplitudes, non-orthogonality, DC offset and common mode signal. Error was analyzed in frequency specter, that yielded a function of error based on input signal deformation. Error is presented in Fourier series form.

\section{Introduction}
These days the need for high quality motor regulation is present in numerous applications and has as a result become unavoidable. For a consistent and reliable measurement of rotation, position sensors are used \cite{uporaba_senzorjev}, such as encoders and resolvers \cite{inkrementalni}\cite{resolver}\cite{enkoder}. Because the output of such sensors is a pair of quadrature sine and cosine signals, angle must first be calculated. The easiest way of doing so is by directly calculating atan2, which returns a value between $[-\pi, \pi]$.

Because position sensors are not ideal, obtained sine and cosine signal can be deformed, phase shifted and DC offset. All of these imperfections cause the calculated angle to also include error.

Literature  \cite{orbis}, \cite{RLS1}, \cite{RLS2} and \cite{RLS3} analyses the impact of such imperfection for lower harmonics only and states that error of imperfections scale linearly. During our research we found, that the error specter also contains higher harmonics. The paper examines error waveform dependent on input signal mismatch with Fourier analysis. 

\section{Methodology and results}
Output from a position sensor can be represented with
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{equ:def_sin}
&Sin = B_{0} + B_1 \sin(\theta + \varphi_{s}) + CMM\\
\label{equ:def_cos}
&Cos = A_{0} + A_1 \cos(\theta + \varphi_{c}) + CMM
\end{eqnarray}

Where $B_0$ and $A_0$ represent DC offset, $B_1$ and $A_1$ signal amplitude, $\varphi_s$ and $\varphi_c$  phase shift and $\theta$ reference angle. Signals (\ref{equ:def_sin}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos}) can also have a common superimposed AC signal  represented as CMM (\ref{equ:CMM}). CMM can be of cosine or sine form with $\Delta_c$ and $\Delta_s$ as amplitude.

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:CMM}
CMM = \Delta_c \cos(\theta)+\Delta_s \sin(\theta)
\end{equation}
By calculating atan2 for eq. (\ref{equ:def_sin}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos})
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:def_kot}
\varphi = \mathrm{atan2}(Sin,Cos)
\end{equation}
and then subtracting it with an unaltered signal
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:def_err}
\varepsilon =\varphi - \mathrm{atan2}(\sin(\theta),\cos(\theta))
\end{equation}
we get error based on deformation. Because  AC signal analysis is simpler in frequency domain, error was converted with Fast Fourier Transform(FFT). By varying each parameter individually we examined the impact of the parameter in question on specter of error. Output of atan2 was examined by sending each parameter in eq. (\ref{equ:def_sin}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos}) to infinity or worst case with phase shift.
In this case amplitude and phase of each harmonic approaches to a limit value.

The course of the amplitude and phase in dependence on the changing parameter was approximated by a function, that best suited numerical waveform obtained from the error spectrum. The set of functions decreases by checking the limit value to which each amplitude and phase approach. We were looking for the best approximation with polynomials, rational functions, exponential, trigonometric and cyclometric functions. The best approximation was sought using the minimum squares method.

\subsection{Defining of error at different amplitudes}
In the first case was observed the impact of different amplitudes on error. The output of the atan2 function is determined by the eq. (\ref{equ:def_sin}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos}) quotient. Since only the ratio of the amplitudes needs to be preserved, we multiplied both signals by $\frac{1}{A_1}$. By changing only the amplitudes in (\ref{equ:def_sin}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos}), input signals are:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{equ:def_sin_ama}
	&Sin = k \sin(\theta),\\
	\label{equ:def_cos_amp}
	&Cos =\cos(\theta),
	\end{eqnarray}
where $k$ represents $\frac{B_1}{A_1}$.

By varying the parameter $k$ from 0 to infinity, it was found that, the error specter consists of even harmonics only. It was also observed that phase shift didn't change. When $k$ approaches infinity, the amplitude of harmonics approaches $\frac{180}{\pi}\frac{2}{n}$, where n represents n-th harmonic. Eq. (\ref{equ:lim_amp_vrsta}) which contains even harmonics only.
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:lim_amp_vrsta}
\varepsilon(k \rightarrow \infty) = \frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} \sin 2 n \theta
\end{equation}
Because second harmonic is the largest, we approximated it first (Figure \ref{fig:amp}).
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Slike/amp.eps}
		\caption{Waveform of the second harmonic depending on $k$} \label{fig:amp}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Best approximation was rational function  (\ref{equ:drugi_har}), with summed squared error (SSE) $1.18 \cdot 10^{-10}$ degrees.
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{equ:drugi_har}
C_2(k)=\frac{180}{\pi}\cdot\frac{k-1}{k+1}
\end{eqnarray}

It was assumed, that higher order harmonics were correlated with base harmonic. Function, that describes error  depending on $k$ is presented in Fourier series form (\ref{equ:amp_err}).
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:amp_err}
\varepsilon(k) =\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(\frac{k-1}{k+1})^n \sin 2 n \theta
\end{equation}
By replacing $k$ with ratio of amplitudes $\frac{B_1}{A_1}$, we get final equation
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:amp_err2}
\varepsilon(A_1, B_1) =\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(\frac{B_1-A_1}{B_1+A_1})^n \sin 2 n \theta,
\end{equation}
which is valid for positive ratio of amplitudes only.
 $$\frac{B_1}{A_1} \geq 0.$$

\subsection{Defining of error at non-orthogonality}
In second case, it was examined the impact of phase deformation. Input signals are represented as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{equ:def_sin_fis}
&Sin = \sin(\theta + \varphi_{s})\\
\label{equ:def_cos_fis}
&Cos =\cos(\theta+\varphi_{c})
\end{eqnarray}
Error was analyzed for each parameter individually and in the end results have been merged.

First analysis was made for parameter $\varphi_s$.
Worst case of error is, when phase parameter approaches $90^\circ$. Error can be presented as Fourier series (\ref{equ:lim_fis_vrsta}). Error contains DC component and even harmonics only.
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:lim_fis_vrsta}
\varepsilon(\varphi_{s} \rightarrow 90^\circ) = 45^\circ - \frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} \sin (2n \theta)
\end{equation}

By varying $\varphi_s$ between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ was found correlation of amplitudes of harmonics with tangent function (Figure \ref{fig:fis}). DC component and phase of error were changed linearly. Tangent function approximate second harmonic with SSE of $1.18 \cdot 10^{-10}$ degrees.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Slike/fis.eps}
		\caption{The waveforms of DC component $C_0$, amplitude of second harmonic  $C_2$ and phase of second harmonic of  error $\varphi_2$ due to ideal cosine signal,depend to phase shift $\varphi_{s}$} \label{fig:fis}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Same procedure was made for parameter $\varphi_c$. Function, that describes correlation of phase shifts of (\ref{equ:def_sin_fis}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos_fis}) to error is represented by Fourier function form (\ref{equ:fis_err}).
\begin{multline}
\label{equ:fis_err}
\varepsilon(\varphi_{s},\varphi_{c}) = \frac{\varphi_{s}+\varphi_{c}}{2}+\\ \frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} (\mathrm{tan}\frac{\varphi_{s}-\varphi_{c}}{2})^n \sin (2n \theta+n(90^\circ +\varphi_{s}+\varphi_{c}))
\end{multline}
Expression (\ref{equ:fis_err}) is valid only for:
$$ \varphi_{s}-\varphi_{c} \in [ -90^\circ , 90^\circ ] $$

\subsection{Defining of error for DC component in one input signal only}
\label{DCoff}
Input signals can contain DC component.
Considering, changing parameters of DC components in (\ref{equ:def_sin}) and (\ref{equ:def_cos}) only, represent input signals as:
\begin{eqnarray}
&Sin = sin(\theta)+ B_0\\
&Cos = cos(\theta) + A_0.
\end{eqnarray}
First was analyzed offset in $Cos$ signal. Parameter $A_0$ approaches infinity and error was described by eq. (\ref{equ:off_lim_vrsta}).
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:off_lim_vrsta}
\varepsilon (A_0 \rightarrow \infty) = \frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{n} \sin (n \theta + n 180^\circ).
\end{equation}
Error does not contain DC component, highest amplitude has first harmonic.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Slike/off.eps}
		\caption{The waveform of amplitude of first harmonic depending to offset  $A_0$, where input signals have amplitude of 1 } \label{fig:off}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The waveform from figure \ref{fig:off}, was split to 3 parts. Expression which best approximate waveform of first harmonic of error with SSE of $1.21 \cdot 10^{-7}$ degrees is in exponential and linear form:
\begin{multline}
\label{equ:offc_err}
\varepsilon(A_0, A_1)=\\
\begin{cases}
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}(2-|\frac{A_0}{A_1}|^{-n}) \sin (n \theta ), & \frac{A_0}{A_1}\leq -1 \\
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n\frac{1}{n}(\frac{A_0}{A_1})^n \sin (n \theta ), & |\frac{A_0}{A_1}|\leq 1 \\
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n\frac{1}{n}(2-(\frac{A_0}{A_1})^{-n}) \sin (n \theta ), & \frac{A_0}{A_1}\geq 1
\end{cases}
\end{multline}

Same procedure was done for DC component in $Sin$ signal. Result is eq. (\ref{equ:offs_err}).
\begin{multline}
\label{equ:offs_err}
\varepsilon(B_0, B_1)=\\
\begin{cases}
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(2-|\frac{B_0}{B_1}|^{-n}) \sin (n \theta -  90^\circ n), & \frac{B_0}{B_1}\leq -1 \\
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(\frac{B_0}{B_1})^n \sin (n \theta + 90^\circ n), & |\frac{B_0}{B_1}|\leq 1 \\
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(2-(\frac{B_0}{B_1})^{-n}) \sin (n \theta^\circ + 90 n), & \frac{B_0}{B_1}\geq 1
\end{cases}
\end{multline}

\subsection{Defining of error for same DC component in both input signals}
Input signals can also contain same DC component. This happen to resolver signals acquired at improper installation of stator coils. Same analysis as in \ref{DCoff} was made and result is presented in eq. (\ref{equ:offsc_err}).
\begin{multline}
\label{equ:offsc_err}
\varepsilon(A_0,B_0=A_0, A_1)=\\
\begin{cases}
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(2-|\sqrt{2}\frac{A_0}{A_1}|^{-n}) \sin (n \theta - 45^\circ n), & \frac{A_0}{A_1}\leq -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(\sqrt{2}\frac{A_0}{A_1})^n \sin (n \theta + 135^\circ n), & |\frac{A_0}{A_1}|\leq \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}(2-(\sqrt{2}\frac{A_0}{A_1})^{-n}) \sin (n \theta +135^\circ n), & \frac{A_0}{A_1}\geq \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{cases}
\end{multline}

\subsection{Impact of CCM signal to error}
CCM signal can be acquired at improper installation of rotor part of resolver.
Added common mode signal to input signals was analyzed for each parameter individually. This paper presents procedure for CCM of cosine signal only. Result of CCM sinusoidal form is appended. Procedure to achieve result was the same.

Procedure started by limitation of error of $\Delta_c$ to infinity. CCM effects to amplitudes and phases of input signals, so was expected that error will contain DC component and even harmonics only.
Error when $\Delta_c$ approaching infinity can be represented in Fourier series form (\ref{equ:lim_dc_vrsta}).
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:lim_dc_vrsta}
\varepsilon(\Delta_c \rightarrow \infty) = 45^\circ -\frac{180}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} \sin( 2 n \theta).
\end{equation}
By varying $\Delta_c$ and analyzing error specter, none result was found.
Than error specter was split to sine and cosine part. In that case waveform of amplitude of second harmonic of error was presented as:
\begin{equation}
C_{2s}(\Delta_c) \cdot\sin(2\theta)+C_{2c}(\Delta_c) \cdot\cos(2\theta)
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:dc} represents waveforms of DC component and split waveform of second harmonic of error.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Slike/dc.eps}
		\caption{The course of offset and amplitude of second harmonic of error due to $\Delta_{c}$} \label{fig:dc}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

DC component was approximated with SSE of $1.94 \cdot 10^{-22}$ degrees with atan function. Waveform of $C_{2s}$ and $C_{2c}$ ware approximated with SSE less then $1.15 \cdot 10^{-9}$ degrees. Functions were  merged to function, that represent course of amplitude as $\sqrt{C_{2s}^2+C_{2c}^2}$ and course of phase as $atan \frac{C_{2c}}{C_{2s}}$. It was assumed, that higher order harmonics were correlated with base harmonic.
Final function that described error depending on $\Delta_c$ is presented in Fourier series form (\ref{equ:dc_err}).
\begin{multline}
\label{equ:dc_err}
\qquad\varepsilon(A_1, \Delta_c) = \mathrm{atan}\frac{\Delta_c}{\Delta_c+2 A_1}+\\
\qquad+\frac{180}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} (\frac{\Delta_c}{\sqrt{\Delta_c^2+2 A_1 \Delta_c+2 A_1}})^n\\ \sin (2n \theta+n (90^\circ+ \mathrm{ atan}(\frac{\Delta_c+A_1}{A_1})))
\end{multline}

Same procedure was made for $\Delta_s$. Result is in eq. (\ref{equ:ds_err})
\begin{multline}
\label{equ:ds_err}
\varepsilon(A_1, \Delta_s) = -\mathrm{atan}\frac{\Delta_s}{\Delta_s+2 A_1}+\\+\frac{180}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} (\frac{\Delta_s}{\sqrt{\Delta_s^2+2 A_1 \Delta_s+2A_1}})^n\\ \sin (2n \theta+n (90^\circ- \mathrm{ atan}(\frac{\Delta_s+A_1}{A_1})))
\end{multline}

Eq. (\ref{equ:dc_err}) and (\ref{equ:ds_err}) are valid for only: 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_s, \Delta_c > -A_1
\end{equation*}

\section{Comment on results}
After defining error due to deformation parameter in input signal, a fault of approximation (\ref{equ:def_err}) was made. Approximated functions were defined with infinite series, during analysis of fault were used first 15 components only. In example input signals have amplitudes $A_1 = 1$ and $B_1 = 1.1$. Difference between error calculated with (\ref{equ:amp_err2}) and error from (\ref{equ:def_err})  is presented in figure \ref{fig:razlika}. Fault of approximation is in the vicinity of a numeric error. Comparing errors in frequency specter, showed minimum deviations between harmonics of same frequency.

It is necessary to mention that despite the derivation, the presented types of errors of individual deformations still depends on each other.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
With methods described in this paper, improper installation of encoders and resolvers can be uncovered from analyzing error only.
Content of higher harmonics in error become non-negligible at major mismatches. This paper presents impact of signal mismatch, non-orthogonality, DC offset and common mode signal to output error of atan2 function.

Input signals can include higher harmonics distortion, which is not described in this paper. The impact of distortion of the input signals in the atan2 function to the output error offers many challenges for further work.
